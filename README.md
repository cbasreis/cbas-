## Yoda Launcher

An automatic resource-pack updater!

The instructions are simple:

  - Note that the file needs to end in a .bat file!
- Double click it and it will automatically check for a new resource-pack version!
  - When the local resource-pack is up-to-date, it will simply launch the original Minecraft launcher.
