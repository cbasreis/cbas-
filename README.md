## Yoda Launcher (deprecated)

An automatic resource-pack updater!

The instructions are simple:

- Download the yoda-launcher.bat from [the releases page](https://github.com/cbasreis/cbas-plus/releases) and save it anywhere you'd like (ex: Desktop).
- Double click it and it will automatically check for a new resource-pack version!
  - When the local resource-pack is up-to-date, it will simply launch the original Minecraft launcher.
- That's it! You can keep using it for launching Minecraft from now on to keep your resource pack updated ðŸ˜‰
